# hello-world
the first repository from KwokCecil

hi,everyone!
I am a college student from China.
I'm following the guide in GitHub, which asks me do this.
To be honest, I'm not sure what I am doing. Maybe this is a introduction as well as my first project in GitHub?
Anyway, I think it's time for next step. Hhhhhh...

Hope I'll be happy in GitHub.
